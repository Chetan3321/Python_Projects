# Learning Python in 100 days

That's awesome, Moon! The "100 Days of Code" challenge is a powerful way to build consistency and real coding skills. Each day usually focuses on a specific concept—like variables, loops, functions, or libraries—giving you hands-on practice through small projects or exercises. The key is to stay consistent, code daily, and reflect on what you learn. By Day 100, you'll have built a strong Python foundation and possibly created portfolio-worthy projects too. Keep going—you’re on the right path!
